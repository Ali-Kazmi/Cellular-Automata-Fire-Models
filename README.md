# Forest-Fires-Cellular-Automata-CX4230

This is a Jupyter notebook for Computer Simulation (CX4230/CSE6730) Spring 2020 at Georgia Tech. This is my second project for the course. We will be using Cellular Automata to model Forest Fires. Please see the Jupyter Notebook for more details. 

Usage: open the ipynb as a Jupyter Notebook. I recommend downloading the ipynb, installing anaconda, using JupyterLab, then (after they display files) navigating to the file and opening it. This will give you full access to the animations.
