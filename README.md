# Forest-First-Cellular-Automata-CX4230

This is a Jupyter notebook for Computer Simulation (CX4230/CSE6730) Spring 2020 at Georgia Tech. This is my second project for the course. 

Usage: open the ipynb as a Jupyter Notebook. I recommend downloading the ipynb, installing anaconda, using JupyterLab, then (after they display files) navigating to the file and opening it. This will give you full access to the animations.
