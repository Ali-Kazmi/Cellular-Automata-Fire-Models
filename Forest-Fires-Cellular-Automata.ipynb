    "## Tutorial goals\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn about Cellular Automata (CA) and how to use them to model forest fires! We will take you from the basic ideas of the field to modern (data driven) hybrid approaches that can model real fires.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites: You should be able to read basic python code. We'll take you through the rest! \n",
    "\n",
    "Forest fires are an important phenomena worldwide. Picture nearby neighborhoods being burned, wildlife being decimated, and smoke polluting the enviornment. Each year, forest fires destroy millions of acres of land. For example, the Lutz Creek fire in British Columbia in August 2018 burned 100,000 hectares (1 hectare is ~2.5 acres)! If we were able to accurately predict where these fires would spread in realtime, we could potentially allocate fire fighters and resources more efficiently, and advise those who need to evacuate with higher certainty. In this tutorial you will learn about some modern methods that have been tried on this problem! "

    "A Cellular Automata (CA from here on) is a model built of cells on a grid. For now, we'll keep this grid one dimensional, but it can theoretically go to any dimension. Each cell is either alive (1) or dead (0). Each cell has a neighborhood, which are the cells around it. \n",

After those are made, you will define an intial state and apply these functions appropriately for however many iterations you want, and plot it so see the results over time.\n",

    "Imagine looking at a field or a forest from the top down. That will be represented as a 2D grid. As iterations continue, we will display the results on that grid. Unlike the 1D case (where we increased the dimension and plotted it over time) we will not plot the evolution over time for this, as that would require a complex 3D visualization. Instead we will animate change over time on a 2d grid. The code to do so will be presented and explained here, so that we can freely utilize in the applications section.\n",

    "## 1: Applications to Forest Fires\n",
    "### 1.1: A simple CA model for forest fires\n",
    "In a paper from 2006, some simple rules were devised to model forest fires. Here we will present those ideas and show them in action. https://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/278897.Ljiljana_Bodrozic_ceepus2006_2.pdf \n",
    "\n",
    "As per the paper, we will use the following possible states. Before we only had two states (1 and 0), but now we will introduce more states to enable more accurate modeling. \n",
    "- 0: can be ignited\n",
    "- 1: fire growing\n",
    "- 2: burnt\n",
    "- 3: burning\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules for this simulation are the following: \n",
    "- An ignitable cell remains ignitable unless at least one neighbor is burning (in which case it is burning in the next step)\n",
    "- A burning cell becomes a burnt cell in the next step.\n",
    "- A burnt cell becomes a growing cell in the next step.\n",
    "- A growing cell becomes ignitable in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper uses a 2D cellular automata, which builds off the core ideas of the game of life. We can expand that code by editing the rules and increasing the number of states. Because we are now modeling a fire, a color scheme change will be a nice bonus! Also, the initial state matters more now, as it is more realistic for a forest to have clumps of ignitable trees and a single source of the fire, so we will define a different seed. "

    "## 2: Literature Review\n",
    "Currently, many methods have been attempted to model forest fires. Many different models have been attempted, but here I wiil focus on cellular automata based studies. The method presented above can be considered almost naive to current techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional studies have focused on creating rule based Cellular Automata based on scientific principles. For instance, a study from 2006 focused on predicting the spread of the fires based on the transfer of fractional burned area, with factors of propagation from diagonal neighbor cells and a rate for the spread of fire<sup>1</sup>. One 2016 paper<sup>3</sup> outlines common rules and provides a Cellular Automata simulator for Forest Fires. These are essentially more detailed versions of what we presented in section 1 of this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "One common method of adding complexity is to add additional geometry to the grid itself. A 2004 study<sup>2</sup> focused on using the same fire spread realtionships (developed by Rothermel in 1972) but on a hexagonal grid instead of a square one. Similarly, a 2006 paper <sup>7<\\sup>utilized voronoi patterning in order to maintain rigid cellular boundaries while simultaneously giving each cell boundaries organic structure. Others simply choose to extend the influence of each cell to its second order neighbors, therefore being affected by the adjacent 24 cells instead of simply its immediate 8 neighbors.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "There also exists a dramatic distinction between the usefulness of vector based model and raster based models. Previously mentioned models are all raster based; a cell has a state represented by a scalar and the states of its neighbors are uniformly influence by that state. Vector based approaches add a layer of complexity in that the propogation and state of the system is represented by a vector, thereby giving the system directionality and momentum. A cell's neighbors need not be influenced uniformly by the state of the cell. However, this adds significant computational complexity. Vector based approaches are valuable on small scale systems, as raster based approaches will create distortions as a result of the discretized geometry of the system, while raster based approaches will more smoothly simulate fire spread on these small scales <sup>8<\\sup>   \n",
    "\n",
    "A more recent paper<sup>4</sup> used a data driven approach to cellular automata. This model was actually tested using data collected from five fires in the United States, and achieved high levels of accuracy in simulating the spread of the fires. What was really unique about this study though was that instead of focusing on defining every aspect of the transition rules as usually done in a Cellular Automaton model it used a feedforward neural network known as the \"Extreme Learning Machine.\" The ELM performed well in predicting each cell's igniting probability. It also was able to account for the impact of vind velocity on the fire spreading pattern. The ELM was integrated with the CA model because a rule based transition system was still implemented, but each iteration the ELM created the transition rules. This could be an interesting avenue to attempt to use within our study.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2017 paper<sup>5</sup> took similar data-driven cellular automata ideas (granted more advanced, as around a decade had passed) and parallelized it, providing GPU implementations of a fully parallel Fuzzy CA model. It was able to achieve parallel speedup, and used data from real fires to improve accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some studies don't focus on adding new details, but instead emphasize different factors of the CA model. For instance, one study<sup>6</sup> suggested that the optimal time step for the forest fire spread CA model is 1/8 of the time taken for the cellular material to be completely combusted. The same article also mentioned being reversible: it can identify fire source points!  "
