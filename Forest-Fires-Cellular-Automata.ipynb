    "A Cellular Automata (CA from here on) is a model built of cells on a grid. For now, we'll keep this grid one dimensional, but it can theoretically go to any dimension. Each cell is either alive or dead. Each cell has a neighborhood, which are the cells around it. We will define a transition function that determines future value of a cell based on its neighbors. Then define a rules function that applys the transition on every cell in a 1d array. After those are made, you will define an intial state and apply these functions appropriately for however many iterations you want, and plot it so see the results over time.\n",

    "## 2: Literature Review\n",
    "Currently, many methods have been attempted to model forest fires. Many different models have been attempted, but here I wiil focus on cellular automata based studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional studies have focused on creating rule based Cellular Automata based on scientific principles. For instance, a study from 2006 focused on predicting the spread of the fires based on the transfer of fractional burned area, with factors of propagation from diagonal neighbor cells and a rate for the spread of fire<sup>1</sup>. A 2004 study<sup>2</sup> focused on using the same fire spread realtionships (developed by Rothermel in 1972) but on a hexagonal grid instead of a square one. One 2016 paper<sup>6</sup> outlines common rules and provides a Cellular Automata simulator for Forest Fires. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more recent paper<sup>3</sup> used a data driven approach to cellular automata. This model was actually tested using data collected from five fires in the United States, and achieved high levels of accuracy in simulating the spread of the fires. What was really unique about this study though was that instead of focusing on defining every aspect of the transition rules as usually done in a Cellular Automaton model it used a feedforward neural network known as the \"Extreme Learning Machine.\" The ELM performed well in predicting each cell's igniting probability. It also was able to account for the impact of vind velocity on the fire spreading pattern. The ELM was integrated with the CA model because a rule based transition system was still implemented, but each iteration the ELM created the transition rules. This could be an interesting avenue to attempt to use within our study.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2017 paper<sup>4</sup> took similar data-driven cellular automata ideas (granted more advanced, as around a decade had passed) and parallelized it, providing GPU implementations of a fully parallel Fuzzy CA model. It was able to achieve parallel speedup, and used data from real fires to improve accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some studies don't focus on adding new details, but instead emphasize different factors of the CA model. For instance, one study<sup>5</sup> suggested that the optimal time step for the forest fire spread CA model is 1/8 of the time taken for the cellular material to be completely combusted. The same article also mentioned being reversible: it can identify fire source points! "
