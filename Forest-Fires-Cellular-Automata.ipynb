    "## Literature Review\n",
    "Currently, many methods have been attempted to model forest fires with cellular automata. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional studies have focused on creating rule based Cellular Automata based on scientific principles. For instance, a study from 2006 focused on predicting the spread of the fires based on the transfer of fractional burned area, with factors of propagation from diagonal neighbor cells and a rate for the spread of fire<sup>1</sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more recent paper<sup>2</sup> used a data driven approach to cellular automata. This model was actually tested using data collected from five fires in the United States, and achieved high levels of accuracy in simulating the spread of the fires. What was really unique about this study though was that instead of focusing on defining every aspect of the transition rules as usually done in a Cellular Automaton model it used a feedforward neural network the autors called the \"Extreme Learning Machine.\" The ELM performed well in predicting each cell's igniting probability. It also was able to account for the impact of vind velocity on the fire spreading pattern. The ELM was integrated with the CA model because a rule based transition system was still implemented, but each iteration the ELM created the transition rules. This could be an interesting avenue to attempt to use within our study.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2017 paper<sub>3</sub> took similar data-driven cellular automata ideas (granted more advanced, as around a decade had passed) and parallelized it, providing GPU implementations of a fully parallel Fuzzy CA model. It was able to achieve parallel speedup, and used data from real fires to improve accuracy. "
